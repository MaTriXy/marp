        It's a time to migrate into <a href="https://marp.app/">Marp Next</a>!
      </h1>
      <p><strong>The publication of classic Marp app has ended.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Marp desktop app, <em>a simple Markdown presentation writer</em>,
        already had stopped maintenance since 2017. Today
        <a href="https://github.com/marp-team/">Marp team</a> is focusing into
        <a href="https://marp.app/">Marp Next</a> project, the brand-new
        presentation ecosystem for the future.
      </p>

            >See more details in our blog post.</a
          ></em
        >
      </p>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        We had kept publishing app for stuck users that are thinking Marp Next
        is too complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        But recently, we received
        <a href="https://github.com/yhatt/marp/issues/276"
          >a serious security report for outdated app</a
        >.
        <strong
          ><em
            >By opening a malicious Markdown, an attacker can execute arbitrary
            code through remote.</em
          ></strong
        >
        We are responsible for saving users from malicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are currently using Marp app,
        <strong><em>please stop using as soon as possible</em></strong> and
        migrate into well-maintained Marp Next tools.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://marp.app/">Marp Next</a> tools</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://marp.app/">Marp Next</a> is not complex! Simply you can
        just use either one if you want to create slide deck.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="Recommended">Marp for VS Code</a></h3>

            >Marp for VS Code</a
          ></strong
        >, an extension for
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>, is the
        best alternative for desktop app users. There are key features inherited
        from the classic Marp app.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live preview</li>
        <li>
          Export to PDF, HTML, and PPTX (via
          <a href="https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli">Marp CLI</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Support built-in 3 themes and custom theme CSS</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli">Marp CLI</a></h3>

        >
        is simple but powerful CLI converter from Marp Markdown into PDF, HTML,
        PPTX, and images. You can use it if you don't want GUI editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have
        <a href="https://github.com/yhatt/marp-cli-example"
          >an example repository</a
        >
        to automate generating slide deck and serving through
        <a href="https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli">Marp CLI</a> +
        <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or
        <a href="https://zeit.co/">ZEIT Now</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Migrate Markdown</h2>
      <p>
        Marp Next is losing Markdown compatibility with classic app, but your
        slide would keep appearance as before just by some changes in most
        cases. Please see
        <a href="https://marp.app/blog/the-story-of-marp-next#migration-plan"
          >our blog post</a
        >
        for details.
      </p>
      <h2>Thanks</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks for a lot of users / contributors of desktop app. Marp has
        changed my life as developer without doubt, and I've learned a lot from
        many feedbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now <a href="https://marp.app/">Marp Next</a> project is evolving built
        on them. I hope you like it too.
